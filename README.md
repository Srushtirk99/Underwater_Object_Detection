# Underwater Object Detection using YOLO11 Architecture

A deep learning project to detect objects in underwater images using a custom YOLO11 model.

## What is This Project?

This project uses a special version of YOLO to find objects in underwater images. It is simple, fast, and easy to use.

## Features

- **Accurate Detection:** Finds objects in underwater images.
- **Custom YOLO11 Model:** A modified version of YOLO for underwater settings.
- **User Friendly:** Easy steps to get started.

## How to Set Up

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/underwater-object-detection.git

```markdown
**Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Download the pre-trained model:**
Follow the link in the documentation or instructions in the repo.

**Download the dataset:**

**How to Use**

- **Add your images:**  
  Place your underwater images in the `images` folder.
  
- **Run detection:**
```bash
python detect.py --input images/your_image.jpg
```

- **View results:**  
  Check the `output` folder to see the detected images.

**How to Train**

If you want to train the model with your own images:

- **Prepare your data:**  
  Organize your images and labels as explained in the documentation.
  
- **Run the training script:**
```bash
python train.py --data dataset_config.yaml
```

**Results:**
