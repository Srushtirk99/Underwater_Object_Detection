## Introduction

Underwater images can be challenging due to low visibility and unusual lighting conditions. Our custom YOLO11 model is designed to detect objects in these images, making it useful for marine research, underwater exploration, and more. This guide will help you set up the project by showing you how to clone the repository and download the necessary dataset.

## Cloning the Repository

Follow these steps to clone the project repository onto your computer:

1. **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt:**
   - **Windows:** Use Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash.
   - **Mac/Linux:** Open the Terminal application.

2. **Run the following command:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srushtirk99/underwater-object-detection.git
